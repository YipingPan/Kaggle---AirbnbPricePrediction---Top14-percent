### Kaggle---AirbnbPricePrediction---Top14-percent
##### This is an inclass competition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/pricelala2/overview. 
##### It is the regression task. I cleaned data and did feature engineering (standardizing, PCA, Encoding, PCA, etc). 
##### Tried linear, random forest, LGB, GB, XGB, MLP(NN) and stacked them into a second level regressor.
##### Through hyperparameter tuning, I analyzed series of problems we might meet in a regression/classification problem including the need for nested CV, out of bag dataset setting, overfitting the target, etc.
##### Finally got 59 MSE and ranked 14% among 450 competitors.
